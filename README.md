# Radical-SR1-Assetto-Corsa

This is my Dissertation where I coded a Radical SR1 into Assetto Corsa. The purpose of the project was to create an accurate model of a race car to decrease costs in motorsport in testing costs.
The Radical was coded through the use of logged data and measurements taken from the real life car.
Any feedback on the model would be greatly appreciated, my email is tomgouldsbrough1@gmail.com if there is anything to mention.
Although the model will not be updated, any feedback would be useful for the future.
You can read my dissertation in the files if you would like to see how everything was made, engineering processes and how the model was compared against real life logged data.
